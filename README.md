We'll start at 1:00 pm and go until 5:00 pm. This event is free to attendees because of our sponsors!

### Curriculum

We'll be using the [Legacy Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/) course on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)! Brand-new coders will start at the [Basic HTML](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#basic-html-and-html5) section.

If you've worked on this course before, you can start where you left off. Be sure to log in to save your progress! The goal for this workshop is to get as far in this course as possible. If you've already finished this certification, consider coaching or volunteering instead!

### Participants

Our audience for this workshop is adults learning about coding with HTML and CSS. We expect to have 20-30 attendees, 10-12 volunteers (including coaches), and a facilitator. Coaches will be experienced developers. Members of underrepresented groups are highly encouraged to attend!

#### Attendees

- We'll let you know whether your [application to attend](https://forms.gle/zwhcyCNG3WXxtbYo6) is accepted as soon as we can.
- You'll need to bring a laptop to this workshop. If you don't have access to one, you can [borrow a Chromebook](https://www.metrolibrary.org/discover/technology#computers) from the Metropolitan Library System.
- We'll be communicating with participants through [Techlahoma's Slack](https://fccokc.com/slack), so joining it is a requirement for this workshop!
- If you're interested but can't make it to the workshop:
    * Fill out the attendee application but mark that you can't go on the attendance question at the end.
    * If you already signed up, let the workshop facilitator know you won't be there.
    * Look for other coding meetups to attend instead at [Techlahoma's Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/techlahoma-foundation). 
    * Join the community in [Techlahoma's Slack](https://fccokc.com/slack).

#### Coaches and Volunteers

- ~~We'll need some coaches for this workshop! Coaching is pretty low-key and low-stress.~~
- We have enough coaches, but contact us about volunteering in other ways!

#### Facilitator

- Please contact facilitator Kimberly Collins (kcollins at techlahoma.org) if you have any questions about the workshop or are interested in sponsorship or volunteering!
- [Kimberly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/collins-kimberly/) is a professional software development consultant with 16 years of experience and strong ties to the local technology community. She has organized numerous user group meetups and networking events, been involved in coding bootcamps, given talks, and mentored junior developers.
